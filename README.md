## History of my life, I guess.

Hello! My name is Wyatt. I have been fond of programming since 2015.

#### 2015
At 9 years old, I began teaching myself Batch, and making simple programs in it. This was my first introduction to any kind of programming.

#### 2016
Sometime in 2016, I began teaching myself Javascript, and running it natively on Windows. ("Microsoft Windows Script Host")<br>
Around late-2016, I began learning HTML5 and making basic websites, and interacting with them using Javascript.

#### 2017
In early 2017 I learned more of what NodeJS was, and learned how it could host websites, create discord bots, etc. I also obtained the fundamental of CSS around this time.<br>
I started making discord bots as a hobby around this time, using [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org) and Node.JS- if you look at my top languages above, I remain to be *quite* fond of it.<br>
In late 2017 I joined my school's [Vex Robotics](https://vexrobotics.com) team, as a coder using a (*ugh*) scratch-based language.

#### 2018
In 2018, I began to experiment with larger-scale operations, and learned about [Glitch](https://glitch.com). Glitch wasn't too restricted back then, and realistically usable for alot of my projects.<br>
I began learning SQL: that was... *fun*.<br>
I joined my new school's Robotics team as a coder once again, using (*ugh*) C++ instead. My team qualified for our states tournament, where we had a total of 4-4 wins/losses

#### 2019
I continued my Robotics pursuit, and my team qualified for our states tournament semi-finalists, although we had a total of 4-5 wins/losses.<br>
At the end of 2019, I began to learn PHP, Bash, Python, and Java for a project.


#### 2020
When Covid hit, I had ***lots*** of times to dedicate to coding. Online school? Unimportant!<br>
To make things even worse for my academic standings, I discovered Grey Hack the summer between 2019-2020. [Grey Hack](https://greyhackgame.com) is a (*personally addicting*) MMO Hacking simulator, with the ability to create in-game programs using greyscript.<br>
Sometime between 2020 and 2021, I began working on a [Visual Studio Code extension for Greyscript](https://github.com/WyattSL), and actively maintain it to this day.<br>
After in-person school did start back around, my robotics team did take a hit. We did have a *somewhat* functional robot in the end, although we didn't qualify for states- we *did* come close, as tournament semifinalists.

#### 2021
And here we are today! What ever will I put here?
